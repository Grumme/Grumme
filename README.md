👋 Hi, I’m @Grumme!

I’m the owner of <a href="https://github.com/orgs/Grumsen-Development-ApS/">Grumsen Development ApS</a>.
Where we help other companies automate and eliminiate manually processes during their work days.

I'm mainly architecting how our systems will be build and at the same time configuring servers, networking and other DevOps related work. To ensure our applications are running but also that the hardening of our system are good.

I love developing Software, which can help people in their daily worklife, and at the same time eliminate human-errors but ensuring everything is handled through code. My real passion is creating iOS application. I love that, you can "play" and use the software with your iPhone or iPad, which makes it almost feel alive!

My drive for during software, is to see people use it - And know that I'm helping a lot of different people.
