👋 Hi, I’m @Grumme!

I’m the owner of <a href="https://github.com/orgs/Grumsen-Development-ApS/">Grumsen Development ApS</a>.
Where we help other companies automate and eliminiate manually processes during their work days.

I'm mainly architecting how our systems will be build and at the same time, configuring servers, networking and other DevOps related stuff. To ensure our applications are running but also that the hardening of our system are good and lives up to the required Security Standards.

I love developing Software, which can help people in their daily worklife, and at the same time eliminate human-errors, by ensuring everything are handled through code. My real passion is creating iOS applications. I love that, when you can "play" and use the software with your iPhone or iPad, which makes it almost feel alive!

The only errors computer do, is when they're wrongly controlled by a Human. That's why we're fightning to automate different areas. People often gets suprised, about simple things, which can make their so much easier, because they don't need to sit and do tidious work.

My drive for during software, is to see people use it - And know that I'm helping a lot of different people, to make their life easier - Just by using their phone or any other products we've been a part of developing.
